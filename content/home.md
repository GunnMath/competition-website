Welcome to Gunn High School's first annual mathematics competition! It will be held **virtually** on the tentative date of March 5th, 2022. Non-Gunn students are welcome to participate as well.

## About

The GMC will be held by dedicated Gunn students from Gunn Math Circle. We invite all aspiring mathematicians of all skill levels!

The competition will have **2 divisions**, A and B, so that competitors' skill levels are well matched. Division B will be for those who are relatively new to competition math and are generally taking a math class before calculus. Division A will be for those who are familiar with competition math, and will thus have harder problems.

Students will compete in **teams of 4**. (Teams of 2 or 3 are ok as well, but they will be at a disadvantage during the team rounds as they have fewer people.) Students may compete individually, but we strongly encourage competing in teams to get the most out of the competition.

## Format

The format is loosely as follows (it's the same for both divisions A and B):

| Round | Time Limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Individual Round | 60 minutes | 10 problems |
| Team Round | 60 minutes | 15 problems |
| Guts Round | 70 minutes | 3x8 problems |

The Individual and Team Rounds are fairly standard. However, in the Guts Round, problems are released in sets of 3. Students must submit answers to the problems in each set before moving on to the next set.

 ## Staff
A huge thanks to our dedicated staff, who are working to put together problems and logistics!
