## About

The fourth annual Gunn Math Competition is hosted by dedicated students from Gunn Math Circle and will be held at Gunn High School on Sunday, March 30th 2025.

## Divisions & Teams
The competition has **2 divisions**, A and B. Division B will be for those who are relatively new to competition math and are generally taking a math class before calculus. Division A will be for those who are familiar with competition math, and will thus have harder problems. Participants who have qualified for the AIME must compete in Division A. 

Students will compete in **teams of 4**. (Teams of 2 or 3 are okay as well, but they will be at a disadvantage during the team rounds as they have fewer people). Students may compete individually, but we strongly encourage competing in teams to get the most out of the competition.

## Format

The format of the tests is listed below.

| Round | Time | # of Problems | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Individual Round | 60 minutes | 10  |
| Team Round | 60 minutes | 15  |
| Guts Round | 70 minutes | 3x8 |
| Tiebreaker Round | 15 minutes | 3 | Qualifiers only! |

In the Guts Round, problems are released in sets of 3. Students must submit answers to the problems in each set before moving on to the next set. This year, we will have multiple activities in the afternoon for students to choose from, including an Estimathon, plank countdown. More details about the exact activities will be announced soon!

## Difficulty

For Div. A, the difficulty of the problems will range from early AMC 10 to mid or late AIME. For Div. B, the difficulty of the problems will range from AMC 8 to late AMC 10. In general, the Guts and Team rounds will be more difficult than the Individual round, as participants are working as a team.

## Schedule

The competition will run from 8:30 AM to 16:30 PM. (All times are in PST.)
