Welcome to Gunn High School's annual mathematics competition! It will be held on the date of March 4th, 2023.

GMC will be held **in person** for the first time this year, for all participants! All participants in nearby middle and high schools, especially those in PAUSD, are encouraged to compete for prizes!

## Registration

Registration is still open at <https://bit.ly/GMC2023>, and join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3jsRqhahJW)!

Also, more detailed and up-to-date information on GMC specifics can be found at our manual, which will be posted **closer to the competition date**. Most of the round information and logistics will be similar to last year's competition (except the in person format), which can be referenced at <https://bit.ly/GMC2022Manual>.

## About

The GMC will be held by dedicated Gunn students from Gunn Math Circle. We invite all aspiring mathematicians of all skill levels!

The competition will have **2 divisions**, A and B, so that competitors' skill levels are well matched. Division B will be for those who are relatively new to competition math and are generally taking a math class before calculus. Division A will be for those who are familiar with competition math, and will thus have harder problems.

Students will compete in **teams of 4**. (Teams of 2 or 3 are okay as well, but they will be at a disadvantage during the team rounds as they have fewer people.) Students may compete individually, but we strongly encourage competing in teams to get the most out of the competition.

## Format

The format of the tests is listed below.

| Round | Time Limit | # of Problems | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Individual Round | 60 minutes | 10  |
| Team Round | 60 minutes | 15  |
| Guts Round | 70 minutes | 3x8 | Optional for B Div. |
| Tiebreaker Round | 15 minutes | 3 | For Qualifiers |

The Individual and Team Rounds are fairly standard. In the Guts Round, problems are released in sets of 3. Students must submit answers to the problems in each set before moving on to the next set. This year, we will have multiple activities in the afternoon for students to choose from, including an esimathon. More details about the exact activities will be announced soon!

## Difficulty

For Div. A, the difficulty of the problems will range from early AMC 10 to mid or late AIME. For Div. B, the difficulty of the problems will range from AMC 8 to late AMC 10. In general, the Guts and Team rounds will be more difficult than the Individual round, as participants are working as a team.

## Schedule

The competition will run from 8:30 AM to 16:30 PM. **All times are in PST.**
