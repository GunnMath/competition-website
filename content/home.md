Welcome to Gunn High School's first annual mathematics competition! It will be held on the date of March 5th, 2022.

Due to district guidelines, GMC will be held **virtually** for all participants. All participants in the **USA** are eligible for prizes, which will be awarded to the top teams and individuals.

## Registration

Registration is still open at <https://bit.ly/GMC2022>, and join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3jsRqhahJW)!

Also, more detailed and up-to-date information on GMC specifics can be found at our manual, <https://bit.ly/GMC2022Manual>.

## About

The GMC will be held by dedicated Gunn students from Gunn Math Circle. We invite all aspiring mathematicians of all skill levels!

The competition will have **2 divisions**, A and B, so that competitors' skill levels are well matched. Division B will be for those who are relatively new to competition math and are generally taking a math class before calculus. Division A will be for those who are familiar with competition math, and will thus have harder problems.

Students will compete in **teams of 4**. (Teams of 2 or 3 are ok as well, but they will be at a disadvantage during the team rounds as they have fewer people.) Students may compete individually, but we strongly encourage competing in teams to get the most out of the competition.

## Format

The format of the tests is listed below.

| Round | Time Limit | # of Problems | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Individual Round | 60 minutes | 10  |
| Team Round | 60 minutes | 15  |
| Guts Round | 70 minutes | 3x8 | Optional for B Div. |
| Estimathon | 30 minutes | 10 | Optional |

The Individual and Team Rounds are fairly standard. In the Guts Round, problems are released in sets of 3. Students must submit answers to the problems in each set before moving on to the next set. In the Estimathon, students will estimate the answer to questions and will be awarded points based on how close they are to the actual answer.

## Difficulty

For Div. A, the difficulty of the problems will range from early AMC 10 to mid or late AIME. For Div. B, the difficulty of the problems will range from AMC 8 to late AMC 10. In general, the Guts and Team rounds will be more difficult than the Individual round, as participants are working as a team.

## Schedule

The competition will run from 9:30 AM to 16:00 PM, with a 10 minute passing period between events. **All times are in PST.**

| Event | Start Time | Duration (in mins) | End Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Opening Ceremony | 9:30 | 15 | 9:45 |
| Individual Round | 9:55 | 60 (+5)* | 11:00 |
| Lunch | 11:00 | 60 | 12:00 |
| Team Round | 12:00 | 60 (+5) | 13:05 |
